# Ethereum Smart Contract Exploration

This is an example I put together of Ethereum blockchain smart contracts.

I pulled from several different online sources and tutorials to get to this:

[Product Manager's Guide](https://hackernoon.com/the-product-managers-guide-to-the-blockchain-part-1-fb95dfb7af31)

[Setting Up A Private Ethereum Network](https://medium.com/@WWWillems/how-to-set-up-a-private-ethereum-testnet-blockchain-using-geth-and-homebrew-1106a27e8e1e)

The voting dapp comes from the first and the private blockchain to run it on comes from the second. 

First, you get the blockchain up by running the create_blockchain.sh and start_blockchain.sh scripts and then creating a new user to mine your blockchain.

Second, you can compile and deploy the example voting smart contract and start the node application to talk to it.
